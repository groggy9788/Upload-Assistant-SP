# L4G's Upload Assistant

A simple tool to take the work out of uploading.

## What It Can Do:
  - Generates and Parses MediaInfo/BDInfo.
  - Generates and Uploads screenshots.
  - Uses srrdb to fix scene filenames
  - Can grab descriptions from PTP/BLU/Aither/LST/OE (with config option automatically on filename match, or using arg)
  - Can strip existing screenshots from descriptions to skip screenshot generation and uploading
  - Obtains TMDb/IMDb/MAL identifiers.
  - Converts absolute to season episode numbering for Anime
  - Generates custom .torrents without useless top level folders/nfos.
  - Can re-use existing torrents instead of hashing new
  - Generates proper name for your upload using Mediainfo/BDInfo and TMDb/IMDb conforming to site rules
  - Checks for existing releases already on site
  - Uploads to ACM/Aither/AL/ANT/BHD/BHDTV/BLU/CBR/FNP/FL/HDB/HDT/HP/HUNO/JPTV/LCD/LST/LT/MTV/NBL/OE/OTW/PSS/PTP/PTER/PTT/RF/R4E(limited)/RTF/SHRI/SN/SPD/STC/STT/TLC/THR/TL/TVC/TTG/ULCX/UTP/YOINK
  - Adds to your client with fast resume, seeding instantly (rtorrent/qbittorrent/deluge/watch folder)
  - ALL WITH MINIMAL INPUT!
  - Currently works with .mkv/.mp4/Blu-ray/DVD/HD-DVDs
